<h2>General Information</h2>

<!--
  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
  This Te Pūnaha Matatini hands-on workshop will provide you with skills essential for efficient manipulation
  of research data. We will try out tools useful for data analysis, visualisation and reporting the results of 
  your research. We will talk about the importance of reproducibility your research. </p>
<p> The workshop is based on the <a href=http://datacarpentry.org>Data Carpentry</a> workshops. We will also have a look

  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.

  <h3>R</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a> is a programming language
    that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and
    statistical analysis. To interact with R, we use
    <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>.

      <p>
        Install R by downloading and running
        <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm">this .exe file</a>

        Also, please install the

        Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the 
        installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as 
        administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later, 
        for example when installing R packages.
